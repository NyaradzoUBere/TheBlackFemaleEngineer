### Hi everybody! My name is the BlackFemale Engineer! ðŸ¤—
<!--
**TheBlackFemaleEngineer/TheBlackFemaleEngineer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### My Focus ðŸ¤“

I primarily like to focus on front-end or full-stack development! My projects (pinned below) have been reflections on my own interests and passions. With each, I maintain sleek modern, designs to maintain a scense of ease throughout the user experience despite the complexity of the apps themselves. 

### My Background ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“Š ðŸ“‰

I graduated from a 4-year university with a B.S.B.A. focused on Finance + Accounting. I have worked at top Big 4 accounting firms and Big 5 banks, however, despite my interest in the subject matter I did not feel fulfilled in my work. My favorite work day was a day in which I, instead of manually filling out an excel sheet to complete the journal entry process of my team, automated the process entirely. And that, ladies and gents, is when I KNEW I was in the wrong feild. And now...here I am!
